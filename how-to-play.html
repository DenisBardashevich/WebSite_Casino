                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>
                                Cricket is a sport that involves a bat and a ball, played between two teams of 11 players each. 
                                The game takes place on a circular or oval field, featuring a 22-yard long pitch at its center.
                            </p>

                                The main goal is to outscore the opposing team in runs. Each team alternates between batting and bowling, 
                                with one aiming to accumulate runs and the other attempting to limit runs and dismiss batters.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Kabaddi is a traditional Indian sport merging elements of wrestling and tag, involving two teams 
                                with seven players each.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The goal is to score points by tagging opponents while holding your breath and returning to your half 
                                of the field.
                            </p>

                                    <b>Raid System</b>: Players take turns raiding; one player from the attacking team (the raider) 
                                    seeks to touch opponents and safely return to their side without getting tackled.
                                </li>

                                            Points are awarded for successfully tagging opponents during a raid.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>

                                        <li>
                                            Points can also be acquired for effectively defending against a raider's attempt.

                                    </ol>

                                    <b>Defensive Strategies</b>: The defending team works to prevent the raider from returning to their half 
                                    by tackling them.
                                </li>

                                    <b>Raid Time Limit</b>: Each raid lasts for 30 seconds. If the raider fails to score in this time, 
                                    a point goes to the defending team.
                                </li>
                
                                <li>
